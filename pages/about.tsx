          <h2>Hi, ðŸ¤š I'm Faizan Ahmed</h2>
        I'm currently a student pursuing my BE in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Since I joined college, I have been very much interested in technology and I wanted to know how these things work in real life. On this note, I've started exploring and learning a few technologies like how websites work and by the way, I was very much interested in Web Development. Coming to my point, I learned the basic fundamentals of Web Development which are of course HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I boosted my learning by building projects on my own and started to explore even more because I could have a hunger to learn new things that fascinated me the most. I learned ReactJS and I was in love with it. Along with it, I learned version control and a few concepts of Linux. To conclude, I'm still learning by building projects and by learning new technologies on daily basis. I would love to share my knowledge by building valuable stuff for your company, looking forward to working with you.
